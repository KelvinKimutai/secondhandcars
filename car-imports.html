    <h1>Car Imports</h1>
  
    <p>Importing cars to USA borders is a process that you can’t just put on cruise control. It’s even more difficult to get the key to that car and drive it across the USA border to importing victory lane.</p>
    <p>Cars are the single most popular purchase for American consumers. They crave cars so much that
     they demand brands from all over the world. That’s where you come in. Importing cars from Europe,
      Germany, Japan and more is a big part of that American consumer car demand process. Learn how to 
      navigate US car import law below in the following four ways.</p>
   <h2>1.Achieve US Car Import Laws Compliance</h2>
   <p>The easiest way to achieve customs clearance approval is to find a Licensed Customs Broker to assist you. When importing cars to USA borders, you need to comply with U.S. importing laws and regulations from various agencies.</p>
   <p>Your car’s parts also need to comply with American standards. For instance, a car that has a speedometer that reads kilometers will have to convert to one that reads miles instead. Other issues include headlight modifications, reflectors, engine and emission modifications and more.</p>
   <h2>2.Utilize the ‘Substantially Similar’ Clause</h2>
   <p>When importing a car to the US, if it’s very similar to other models that are already manufactured in America, you can take advantage of the Substantially Similar Clause. This clause is primarily used when importing cars from Canada. That’s because American and Canadian cars typically have interchangeable parts. If customs agents agree that your import is similar to American models, it receives a green light for importing.</p>
   <h2>3.Take Advantage of the Show and Display Rule</h2>
   <p>Did you know that Bill Gates, Ralph Lauren and other American businessmen banded together more than 25 years ago to get a law passed that allowed them to drive European car imports legally in the United States? The Show and Display rule allows certain cars exemptions from U.S. government regulations, as long as the cars are brought over for “show and display.”</p>
   <h2>4.25 Year Old Age Limit</h2>
   <p>Need an easier way to import a car to the US? The day a car reaches its 25th birthday, it’s legally allowed to pass customs clearance in the United States with no restrictions. Happy Birthday older cars! Your present is no inspections whatsoever!</p>

    <p>There are only two hurdles to the 25 year rule. The state where your import car is going may require modifications for safety items to receive a tag and registration. And in the state of California, older cars mandate stricter emission requirements for all cars manufactured after 1975.</p>
